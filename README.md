This repo consists of the two excercises given by Kthfs; Kth Formula Student.

## Excersise 1

To run the nodes you must first have rospy, installed by running the command in command window (I used Ubuntu):

```
sudo apt-get install python-rospy
```

Here two nodes were to be created, where one published


## Excersise 2

Here I have made three classes. One for simple one time plots, one for animation of a function, and lastly one for live data plotting.

To run all of these you will need matplotlib and numpy. These can be downloaded using

```
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
```

Alternetavely, use pip3 instead of pip.

When writing the animation class, I used matplotlibs website, [Matplotlib on its animation api](https://matplotlib.org/api/animation_api.html), as a reference.

For the live update, I used [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4098131/how-to-update-a-plot-in-matplotlib) thread as a guide.
